## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- **Search and Discovery**: Advanced search functionality to find poems by title, author, or genre.
- **Authentication**: **Laravel Sanctum** is used for user authentication and token-based authorization.
- **Media Handling**: Secure storage and management of poetry media (audio, video, and images).
- **Admin Dashboard**: A backend interface to manage users, poetry content, and platform settings.
